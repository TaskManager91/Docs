<h1>Authentication</h1><br>
Authorization of requests is done via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side">HTTP basic access authentication</a>.<br>

<strong>HTTP basic accesss authentication header example</strong><br>
<pre>Authorization: Basic TWVyY2hhbnRJRDpBUElLZXk=</pre><br>
	<br>
TWVyY2hhbnRJRDpBUElLZXk= is the base64 encoded version of "MerchantID:APIKey". A merchant id could look like "Merchant-00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000", and an API key could look like "xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX".<br>
The merchant id and the API Key can be found in the Payengine Merchant Center under "My Account".<br>

Now that we know how to authenticate we will try our first connection.<br>

Following examples are using <a href="https://curl.haxx.se">curl</a> to establish a connection.<br>

We will now establish the first connection to the API.<br>

<pre>
curl --user MerchantID:APIKey https://apitest.payengine.de/v1/customers
</pre><br>

The response should look like following.<br>

<pre>
{
    elements: []
    totalpages: 1
}
</pre><br>

Since it is the first request there are no customers whom could be returned.<br>
<br>
<strong>https://apitest.payengine.de/v1</strong> is the test system which should always be used for development purposes, the live api endpoint would be <strong>https://api.payengine.de/v1</strong>. For more information on the system URLs see <a href="/faq">System URLs</a>.
