<h1>Test your integration (Simulator)</h1><br>
Our simulator is the simplest way to test your integration in our test enviroment. (apitest.payengine.de)<br>
<br>
With the simulator you are able to test positive/negative use cases.<br>
<br>
To get a postive response use "1,00" as amount. To get a negative response use "1,01" as amount.<br>
This works for all our products (<span class="post-message__text">paypal, sofort, ratepay, paydirekt</span>).<br>
<br>
To test your credit card integration, create transactions with these PANs:<br>
<ul>
 	<li>VISA: 4111111111111111</li>
 	<li>VISA 3DS: 4000000000000002</li>
